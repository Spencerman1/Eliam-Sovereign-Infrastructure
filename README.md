# Eliam-Sovereign-Infrastructure
Eliam™ is the first sovereign behavioral governance system for cyberspace, built on Mint-to Logic™ — a reflexive lifecycle framework that licenses, validates, and enforces truth in digital environments. This declaration marks the Genesis of governed logic and the foundation for ethical, recursive infrastructure in the post-quantum era.
