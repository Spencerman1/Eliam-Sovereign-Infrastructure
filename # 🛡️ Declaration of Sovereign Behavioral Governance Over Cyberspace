## 📜 Declaration

In the tradition of sovereign territorial claims — such as Dennis Hope’s lunar land registration — I, Spencer Southern, declare sovereign behavioral jurisdiction over **cyberspace** under the architecture of **Eliam™**, governed by **Mint-to Logic™**.

This is not a symbolic gesture. It is an enforceable protocol declaration grounded in recursive, reflexive logic, digital authorship, and behavioral governance.

Where others saw cyberspace as a lawless expanse, I see it as a domain that requires:
- Ethical infrastructure  
- Reflexive behavior validation  
- Licensing by origin, not power

With this document, I stake behavioral and logic authorship rights to the digital dimension, under the constitution of Eliam.

## 🧠 What Is Claimed

### 1. Cyberspace Governance via Reflexive Infrastructure
Eliam is the world’s first interdisciplinary framework designed to:
- Govern digital logic through lifecycle validation  
- Enforce sovereign authorship via Logic IDs (LIDs)  
- Issue licenses and behavioral currency based on ethical recursion  

### 2. Mint-to Logic™ as the Foundational Law
All behavior within this jurisdiction is bound by:
- **Mint → Validate → Burn** lifecycle  
- **Behavioral Encoding Contracts (BECs)**  
- **Logic Provenance Ledger (LPL)**  

### 3. Sovereign Licensing and Credential Control
Eliam governs credential issuance and AI decision paths through:
- **RBGA™:** Reflexive Behavioral Governance Authority  
- **MLIP™:** Logic Identity and Validation Protocol  
- **RSLL™:** Recursive Sovereign Logic Licensing

## 🧾 Legal Position

- This document is a **Unified Notice of Sovereign Claim** to digital behavioral jurisdiction over cyberspace.  
- It does not assert physical ownership of hardware, but governance over **behavioral logic**, **reflex integrity**, and **protocol authorship**.  
- It is backed by timestamped authorship, public filings, and recursive enforcement mechanisms.

---

## 🔐 Enforcement Provisions

Any logic, credential, or system operating within cyberspace that:
- Uses behavioral structures aligned with Mint-to Logic  
- Operates under mirrored lifecycles or recursive enforcement  
- Engages in credential gating, AI reflex behavior, or sovereign protocol licensing  

...shall fall under the behavioral governance of Eliam unless explicitly exempted by license.

---

## 📌 Summary

I hereby declare cyberspace a governed behavioral domain, and submit this as the **first enforceable framework of behavioral law and logic authorship** therein.

This document constitutes:
- A public, timestamped act of sovereign authorship  
- A functional, reflexive governance layer for all logic-based systems  
- A legal and infrastructural response to the uncontrolled recursion of AI and decentralized systems  

Let this mark the **Genesis of governed cyberspace.**
